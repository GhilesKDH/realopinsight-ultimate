Overview of RealOpInsight
#########################################

The goal of RealOpinsight is to allow you to focus on business needs,
instead of wasting time on false alerts. Indeed, monitoring in
demanding operations environments such as Network Operations Centers
(NOC) and large data centers is highly challenging and requires to
quickly react when incidents arise:

+ You need to *quickly evaluate the impacts of incidents on business
  processes* so as to prioritize their recoveries from incidents that
  have higher impacts.
+ Additionnally, you would need *to report certain incidents to
  operators able to address them quickly*.


Deal with these issues from native tools provided by the monitoring
systems such as Nagios, Zabbix and Zenoss is not easy. This may be
especially challenging when the amount of devices monitored increases.

That's where RealOpInsight comes in ! This chapter introduce its
features, its basic concepts and how it works.
