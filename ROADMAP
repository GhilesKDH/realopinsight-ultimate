- code clean of miscellaneous miss programming
- built-in authentification system: 
	**two user profiles: administrator (user: hilena_adm) & operator (user: hilena_op)
	NOTE: For that the authentification system works normaly and securely, the application has to be executed under the identity of a user that has suitable access on the settings file. Then the SEUID bit will be set on the application binary file, while the Xserver ACL has to be set to enable a local access to the Xserver for that user.
