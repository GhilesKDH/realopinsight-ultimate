RealOpInsight ChangeLog
###############################
3.2.0 (ibericus)
  * Added support for Pandora FMS monitoring backends. Based on
    Pandora FMS's API, any versions of Pandora FMS starting from
    version 4.0.2 should be fully compatible. Older versions may not
    work if your Pandora FMS is protected by a password, because the
    name of the password parameter has been changed since then.
  * Now sets the default propagation severity to Unknown
    in order to fix some inconsistencies in status propagation.
  * Misc fixes to simplify code and improve performances

3.1.1
  * Fixed problem when the average calculation rule with thresholds always returns
    average severity.
  * Added the ability to compile RealOpInsight Workstation without the support of ZMQ
    and QtWebkit. This aims to provide a minimal software that can work on Linux
    distributions, such as RedHat and CentOS, whose certain versions do not natively
    provide packages for the aforementioned tools.
  * Misc typos related to contextual messages.

3.1.0
  * Added the support of weighting services (see ticket #45). Weighting enables
    you to associate a weight factor with a service. The weight factor can be any
    real number between ``min=0`` and ``max=10``, determining how important the
    service is to its parent service compared to other sibling services.
    With this, you can for example deal with situations such as, essential services
    (i.e. services required for your business services), neutral services (i.e. services
    without any impact on your business services), etc.
  * Modified the average calculation rule algorithm to take into account the weights
    of direct subservices when calculating the status of a service (Weighted Average).
  * Added new status calculation rule (Weighted Average With Thresholds), based on
    weighted average along with status escalation thresholds (see ticket #47).
    This rule improves the simple weighted average rule described above. In addition,
    it provides the ability to escalate a severity when given thresholds of similar
    events are reached. For example, you may want to escalate the severity from Major
    to Critical if more than 50% of services are in Major state.
  * Added the ability to set the application language via preference settings.
  * Other changes include the ability to make the compilation of ngrt4nd and the
    embedded web browser optional.
    This removes the requirement on ZeroMQ and QtWebKit which are not natively
    available on some versions of Red Hat-based operating systems (e.g. Red Hat/CentOS 6).

3.0.5
  * Fixed ticket #41 when chart is not well updated with
    Livestatus backend
  * Fixed version display in welcome message
  * Use UTF8 as default character encoding system for Livestatus backend
  * Now retrieve data from Livestatus basing JSON format. Aims to fix problem
    with line break in message details. See ticket #43

3.0.4
  * Added the ability to filter data points to import within
    the editor basing on host groups (see ticket #39). In addition
    to the existing host filter, this feature in middle and
    large monitoring environments provides a good tradeoff
    between (i) host-based filtering, which could be heavy to handle
    with many hosts; and (ii) no filter at all, which can generate
    a huge number of items, thereby making the selection of
    data points faily difficult.
  * Added the ability to search and filter data points in the editor.
    In addition to the host group-based filter, this feature enables
    users to search/filter data points according to string patterns
    or host groups.
  * Host groups are now display on data-point services' tooltips in the
    Operations Console
  * Fixed encoding problems on Livestatus backend when some data entries
    appear to be ill-formed after decoding. Ticket #38.
  * We thank to B5r1oJ0A9G@Github and zodrac@Github for their
    feedback, commitments and contributions for this release.

3.0.3
  * Fixed ticket #31 adding the ability from the editor to import data
    points from network-based Livestatus endpoints. This feature
    complements the existing capabilities to import data points
    from Zabbix, Zenoss and from Nagios status file.
  * Rewrite in the Livestatus backend using native socket for
    simplification and performance improvements.
  * Fixed ticket #35 related to date display with livestatus backend.
  * Fixed ticket #35 related to dashboard refreshing in RealOpInsight Workstation.
  * Fixed ticket #36 related to the computation of average severity.
    Graph-based traversal algorithms were introduced to improve the
    performance as well as the accuracy of severities computation.

3.0.2
  * Fixed editor crash on native check service deletion (ticket #27)
  * Fixed missing librairies in Windows binaries causing fail on
    Windows plugin loading (ticket #28)

3.0.1
  * Fixed importation of Nagios status file in the editor
  * Added ability to import Zabbix triggers and Zenoss components
    from the editor
  * Fixed problem in mono-source handling when the description
    file-defined source type was overriden by the setting source type
  * Simplified monitoring-data retrieving with Zabbix and Zenoss
  * Now disables the workstation operations console when updating
    the console after preferences changed
  * Added french translation for new string added by changes

3.0.0 (Eliana)
  * Changed command line names: ngrt4n-oc -> realopinsight-oc, 
    ngrt4n-manager -> realopinsight-manager, ngrt4n-editor -> 
    realopinsight-editor

  * Fixed Editor file open when the name of the root service is altered

  * Lot of refactoring and code simplification
  * Port to Qt 5.x
  * Livestatus is now the default mode selected for retrieving monitoring data

    Nagios

--------------
  * Added option for hiding/showing the auth chain
  * Fixed bug #1: The severities of Zabbix triggers are now supported.
  * Updated the preferences window for easing the setting of monitoring settings

2.1.0beta1 - 27/10/2012
--------------
  * Added support for Zabbix: Requires Zabbix >= 1.7. 
    Known Issues: the severities of triggers are not yet taken into account. 
    All problems are simply reported. This will be fixed before the stable 
    release (ticket #1). 

  * Released the UI Module and the Daemon Module as seperate packages. 
    The UI Module became 'RealOpInsight' while the Daemon Module, specific 
    to Nagios, is now called 'Daemon Service for Nagios'.

  * VERY IMPORTANT: To support both Zabbix and Nagios without additional 
    configuration constraints for the administrators, the format of configuration 
    files has been modified to detect automatically the target monitoring system 
    at the loading time. Nevertheless, for backward compatibility, the former 
    format is still supported and detected as compatible with Nagios. 
    It's recommended to upgrade the format of your former configuration files: just 
    open the each file from the Editor and resave it (File -> Save).

  * Changed of the format of message exchanges between the Daemon 
    Service for Nagios and the Operations Consoles for better 
    performance and better performance and more flexibility. It's 
    required to upgrade the Daemon Service towards the version 1.1.0.

  * Bug fix: Added more robustness in the communications to prevent situations 
    of infinite waiting when the Daemon Service for Nagios does not respond.

  * Bug fix: minor changes on the management of update interval.

  * Bug fix: fixed the problem when the native check field appears empty when there 
    is no Nagios status file loaded.

  * Deprecated command: 'ngrt4n', now use 'ngrt4n-manager' instead.

  * The Windows Installer has been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 8. 
    Please remove any older version of NGRT4N before installing RealOpInsight.
